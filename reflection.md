Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
When working on A3, I consulted with Greta Wang.

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
I attended Ab's office hours on 9/19 and 9/22, and Hia's office hours on 9/24.

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
My initial impression of Java is that the syntax is simultaneously logical but not intuitive. By this I mean that the different classifications of public and private, for example, are logical, but I would not have intuitively thought to include those qualifiers if writing code from scratch.

- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Comparing Java and Python, I can see a lot of similarities in programming, such as initialization and constructors. Furthermore, there are many small differences (like self vs. this) which are both helpful, as the intuition carries over, but also confusing, as I sometimes mix up the syntax. There are also larger differences, such as how everything in Java has to be inside a class.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Right off the bat, I was able to create code that received input from the user, returned the same response to all of the inputs, added both input and response to a transcript, and printed the transcript. After that, I was able to talk to Ab and figure out how to create a for loop of different lengths, given a user input specifying the desired number of “rounds” of the game. Furthermore, Ab suggested I look at a list of functions available for strings, which is where I found the function contains that I used in my if-ladder for mirroring. One thing I struggled with for a while was handling my mirroring responses and randomized responses, and making sure to add the correct one to the transcript in the correct scenario. In talking with Greta, I was able to fix this problem.
